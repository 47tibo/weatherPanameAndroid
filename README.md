## Technical specs

### Weather data API

Weather data for Paris is retrieved from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/).
API is autogenerated with [OpenAPI generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/), with all the configuration
and template in `weather` subproject, under `/open_weather_api`.

The `OpenWeather.yaml` file is created by transforming a Postman collection containing an OpenWeather
JSON response to an OpenAPI scheme. This, thanks to [this tool](https://kevinswiber.github.io/postman2openapi/).

Once the proper scheme is created, in order to generate the API, simply run :

```
./gradlew openApiGenerate
```

### Third party artifacts and integration

- Hilt for DI
- Retrofit for network requests
- Ktlint for linting, runs on pre-push
- Kover for code coverage runs on Bitrise

### Application architecture

Based on Robert C. Martin's _Clean Architecture_, more precisely the **package by components** packaging strategy,
proposed by Simon Brown in chapter 24.

The architecture diagram is `components_architecture.drawio` file, at the root of this project.
This file has to be open with [DrawIO](https://app.diagrams.net/) tool (free and really cool).
