# Weather Paname ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· â›…

## Features

Weather in Paris in a blink !
Hourly detail for the current day, by segment on the next 7 days.
There is more ! You will discover : 
- temperature in celsius
- wind direction
- blowing power

Say bye to bad surprises when leaving the subway (or riding your bike).

## Technical specs

### Code convention

Ktlint via [kotlinter](https://github.com/jeremymailen/kotlinter-gradle).
Personal choices :
- for functions arguments, the default is positional. Indeed Android Studio gives enough intel on arguments.
I use named arguments only for disambiguation, when optional arguments are in the function's signature.
- for abbreviations, I use capitalize case, not screaming case. Eg : Dto, not DTO
- tests files (unit and e2e) use `Test` in their names : as a prefix for _stubs_ and as suffix for _tests classes_

### Weather data API

Weather data for Paris is retrieved from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/).
API is autogenerated with [OpenAPI generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/), with all the configuration
and template in `weather` subproject, under `/open_weather_api`.

The `OpenWeather.yaml` file is created by transforming a Postman collection containing an OpenWeather
JSON response to an OpenAPI scheme. This, thanks to [this tool](https://kevinswiber.github.io/postman2openapi/).

Once the proper scheme is created, in order to generate the API, simply run :

```
./gradlew openApiGenerate
```

> Note : The generated DTO fields are all nullable. Instead of a painful configuration of OpenAPI's 
> templates, I've choose to use the not null assertion operator in `WeatherAssembler`.

### Third party artifacts and integration

- Hilt for DI
- Retrofit for network requests
- Ktlint for linting, runs on pre-push
- Kover for code coverage runs on Bitrise (release flavor)

### Application architecture

Based on Robert C. Martin's _Clean Architecture_, more precisely the **package by components** packaging strategy,
proposed by Simon Brown in chapter 24.

The architecture diagram is `components_architecture.drawio` file, at the root of this project.
This file has to be open with [DrawIO](https://app.diagrams.net/) tool (free and really cool).

Separation between abstraction and concrete implementation (especially for remote data sources) is handled via
Hilt Modules bindings.

Specific concepts of Repository, Gateway, DTO & Assembler are extract from Eric Evans & Martin Fowler 
books _Domain Driven Design_ & _PEAA_.

Data flows contain Kotlin's `Result`, which are created on the lowest level (in architectural term), ie
in the network layer implementation. This in order to wrap exceptions as soon as possible, as recommended 
in this [Kotlin Conf talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvYAQNT4o0I).

#### `weather`component

This component is an android library, packaged as a gradle subproject. It contains all the business and data-providing
logic to retrieve and expose data about Paris' weather. It strictly follows encapsulation and dependency rule,
using `internal` modifiers and `interfaces` (to define contracts and for DIP, when needed).
